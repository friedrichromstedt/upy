0.3.6b 2/10
------

Adding the workaround for the numpy calling convention for equal() and 
not_equal() also to the equal() wrapping class.

0.3.5b 2/10
------

Splitted core.py into several modules: dependency.py, characteristic.py,
id_generator.py, operators.py.  core.py now only holds the undarray class.

0.3.4b 2/10
------

Enhancement of the numpy operator overload: Original, maybe already
overloaded operators are maintained.

0.3.3b 2/10
------

BUGFIXES with the error source ID generation.
Warnings in averaging.mean() and averaging.representative().
Current tests passing ok.

0.3.2b 2/10
------

Changing the error source name generation from id(dependency) to id(sigma).
This should be error-prone now.  See the CHANGELOG of core.py for details.

0.3.1b 2/10
------

Overloads for numpy's numeric operators are implemented.  I.e., statements
with undarrays as second operand work.

0.3.0b 2/10
------

A working undarray instance and the arithmetic, the averaging and the linear
regression are implemented.
