=====  Somewhen in August 2015  =====


At the moment, the array is printed "twice":

1.  In order to find the maximum widths;
2.  In order to find the complete str.

This is probably not the Right Thing (tm).

Alternative:

-   Using a subclass of str, which can adjust its width.
-   Returning a concatenation of such str subtypes.
-   Ordinary __str__ conversion of the str subclass returns the
    subclass instance unchanged
-   A special method can be called upon to finalise the string,
    resulting in an ordinary 'str' instance.

undarrays are typeset by "Typesetters".  They hold the typesetting
parameters for their kind of typesetting.  There are:

-   float typesetters;
-   int typesetters;
-   exp typesetters.

To print an undarray, a method of the typesetter is called with the
undarray in question as argument.

There exists a default typesetter 'upy.typesetter' which is used in
case of ordinary 'print ua' et al.  It can be set via a method
'upy.set_typesetter', which prevents typos to go without notice.

Typesetters are definitive in terms of typesetting type performed.
Making the ouput dependent on the kind of undarray handed over (float,
integer) is deprecated by this.  No magic please.

Subclassing the return value from 'str' is necessary only because the
return value need to be an instance of 'str'.

Upon calling ``undarray.__str__``, the following mechanism is used:

1.  The object ndarray is populated by iterating over the flattened
    contents of the undarray, and reshaping the result.

2.  The __str__ method of that object ndarray is invoked, returning an
    instance of the ``str`` subclass.  While the elements of the
    object ndarray are passed through ``str`` by numpy, the width
    variables are updated to record the maxmimum width.

3.  Inside of the ``undarray``\ 's ``__str__`` method, the returned
    ``str`` subclass instance is "finalised", returning the string
    bodies padded to the maximum width.

4.  The such resulting ordinary ``str`` instance is returned by the
    ``undarray.__str__`` method.

Instances of the augmented ``str`` subclass never propagate to the
user level.
